## Version 2 breaking changes
The repository and action has been renamed from godot-android-upload to simply godot-android-export to simplify the action and to remove third party actions dependencies.
Now this actions follows the Unix philosophy of simply doing one thing well.
You can then upload the aab/apk export  of your game where ever you want.
